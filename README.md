All my work in EEE 391 - Basics of Signals and Systems course. 

## Matlab Assignment 1 - Fourier Series and Sampling - Score: 40/100

**Assignment 1 Topics:**
- Part A: Perform basic operations regarding Fourier series and sampling.
- Part B: Compute the Fourier series coefficients of a voice recording and re-synthesize the voice from the computed Fourier series coefficients. Investigate the effect of some changes on the Fourier series coefficients on the re-synthesized voice.

## Matlab Assignment 2 - Image Processing - Score: 87/100

**Assignment 2 Topics:**
- Perform simple operations on gray scale (white and black) digital images and see the results.
- Work with two-dimensional signals and store images in matrices in Matlab.
